## Simple Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains sample projects related to computer vision.

## Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV

### Overview

The **Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV** project designed to detect face and calculates the distance between the camera and a person's face based on known measurements. The distance is calculated using the focal length, which is determined from a reference image where the face width is known.

### How to Use

To get started with the Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV project, navigate to the [Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV](./Face%20Detection%20and%20Measurement%20using%20OpenCV/) directory.

## Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8

### Overview

The **Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8** project is designed to detect object and calculates the distance between the camera and a detected object (e.g., person) based on known measurements. The distance is calculated using the focal length, which is determined from a reference image where the object width is known.

### How to Use

To explore the Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8 project, visit the [Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8](./Object%20Detection%20and%20Measure%20Distance%20using%20YOLOv8/) directory.


## Serve an ML Model using FastAPI

### Overview

The **Serve an ML Model using FastAPI** project is to serve as an Image Classifier API using FastAPI, allowing users to make predictions on images.

### How to Use

To explore the Serve an ML Model using FastAPI project, visit the [Serve an ML Model using FastAPI](./Serve%20an%20ML%20Model%20using%20FastAPI/) directory.
