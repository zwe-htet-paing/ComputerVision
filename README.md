This repository contains sample projects related to computer vision.

## Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV

### Overview

The **Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV** project designed to detect face and calculates the distance between the camera and a person's face based on known measurements. The distance is calculated using the focal length, which is determined from a reference image where the face width is known.

### How to Use

To get started with the Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV project, navigate to the [Face Detection and Measurement using OpenCV](./Face%20Detection%20and%20Measurement%20using%20OpenCV/) directory.

## Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8

### Overview

The **Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8** project is designed to detect object and calculates the distance between the camera and a detected object (e.g., person) based on known measurements. The distance is calculated using the focal length, which is determined from a reference image where the object width is known.

### How to Use

To explore the Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8 project, visit the [Object Detection and Measure Distance using YOLOv8](./Object%20Detection%20and%20Measure%20Distance%20using%20YOLOv8/) directory.
